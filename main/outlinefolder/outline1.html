<h1>Idea for Website</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
	The purpose of this project is to help first time pet owners with the challenges of owning a pet for the first time (dogs and cats to be more specific). Agile method will best fit this project since I would need flexibility to change the website whenever needed.

	<h1>Measuring Progress</h1>
<p>I will be measuring progress by setting goals every week what I want 
	for the website. I will then show the final draft to the sponsor, 
	evaluator, and others for their opinion how I can approve the website. 
	Below is the milestones and the time it should take for each milestone.
	<br><br>Milestone 1 Creating the outline of the pages (timelimit 1 week)<br>
	Milestone 2 Completion of main page (timelimit 2 weeks)<br>
	Milestone 3 ComplSetion of second page (timelimit 2 weeks)<br>
	Milestone 4 Completion of third (timelimit 2 weeks)<br>
	</p>
	<br<br>
	<p>A scope statement - what is the concept, the first major deliverable, and how long will this piece take?  (1-2 paragraphs)
		Backlog - what are the major pieces and minor enhancements? This is a "sticky note" wall.
		Human Resources - who's filling what roles?
		A communication plan - when are you meeting? Do you have alternate communications?
		Costs - how much are you going to spend and on what?
		Risks - what are the major risks you face? What are some unexpected risks?</p>
